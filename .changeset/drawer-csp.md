**CSP: `@nexub/react` no longer injects a `<style>` tag on load.** The Drawer library (vaul) added one as soon as `@nexub/react` was imported, even with no Drawer on the page, which strict Content-Security-Policy pages block. vaul is now bundled into `@nexub/react` with that call removed, and its styles ship in `@nexub/themes/base` instead. Apps that import `@nexub/themes/base` (all of them) need no change, and a strict CSP no longer needs a hash for that style. The build fails if vaul's styles and `base.css` drift apart. `vaul` moves from dependencies to devDependencies.
