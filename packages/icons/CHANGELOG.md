### Minor Changes

- efe17f9: Reorder.

  - **`Sortable`** (new, beta): a list people reorder by dragging an item or with Alt+ArrowUp/Down on its handle. Focus stays on the moved item's handle and every move is announced ("Alpha moved to position 3 of 5").
  - **`Kanban`** (new, beta): columns of cards. Drag cards, or Alt+ArrowUp/Down within a column and Alt+ArrowLeft/Right across columns (mirrored in RTL). Columns are regions named by their headings.
  - **`DataTable`**: `onRowOrderChange` adds a row handle column for the same drag and Alt+Arrow moves; `getRowLabel` names rows. Handles hide while a column is sorted.
  - Built on the native drag-and-drop API, the same model as DataTable column reordering: no new dependency.
  - **Icons**: `GripVertical`.
  - New messages: `moveItem`, `reorderHint`, `itemMoved`, `itemMovedToColumn`.

### Minor Changes

- b71b56f: States and safety.

  - **`EmptyStatePreset`** (new): ready-made empty states (`noData`, `noResults`, `noAccess` for 403, `serverError` for 500, `offline`), with an icon, localised title and description, and optional `actions`. Errors are announced. `EmptyState` itself stays a server component.
  - **`AlertDialog.Confirm`**: type-to-confirm for irreversible actions. The Action button stays disabled until the given `text` (for example, the resource name) is typed.
  - **`OTPInput`** (new, beta): one box per digit with `autocomplete="one-time-code"`, so codes from SMS fill every box. Supports paste-to-fill, Backspace and arrow keys, `onComplete`, `mode="alphanumeric"`, `invalid` and `name` for forms.
  - **`FileUpload.Item`**: `progress` (0–100) shows a bar, `onCancel` swaps the remove button for "Cancel upload" while uploading, and `error` shows why a file failed. Your app does the upload.
  - **Icons**: `Inbox`, `ServerCrash`, `WifiOff`.
  - New messages: `emptyStates`, `typeToConfirm`, `verificationCode`, `uploadProgress`, `cancelUpload`.

### Minor Changes

- 1ad3138: Dependency upgrades. `@nexub/icons` now uses lucide-react 1.x; every exported icon keeps its name, and a few glyphs are redrawn upstream. `DatePicker` and `DateRangePicker` use react-day-picker 10; their props and behaviour are unchanged. The packages are now built with TypeScript 6.0, tsup 9 and vite 8.

## 2.7.0

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a97fb4: Native marks and `SkeletonSwap` for React Native.

  - `@nexub/icons/native` now has the Nexub marks under the same names as on web: `NexubMark` (`variant="color"` draws the brand gradient), `LeapMark`, `BookubMark`, `PayubMark`, `FounderubMark`, `ACRA`, `IRAS`, `MCA` and `GST`. They take the usual `size`, `color` and `label` props.
  - `@nexub/react-native` adds `SkeletonSwap`, the twin of the web component: it crossfades from a skeleton to the loaded content in place on the motion springs, marks itself busy for screen readers while loading, and follows Reduce Motion. Content that is ready on first render shows without a fade.

## 2.4.0

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c67c72a: Published with npm trusted publishing (OIDC) from the `Nexub-AI/nexub-ds` release workflow, so every version now carries npm provenance: you can check on npmjs.com that it was built from this repository's source. No code changes.

## 2.3.0

## 2.2.0

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 736b9a5: **React Native support, foundations** (MOBILE_PLAN.md, phase M1):

  - New `@nexub/core`: the strings, locale direction, money formatting and shared prop types (`ToneValue`, `GlassMode`, …), now shared by web and native. `@nexub/react` re-exports everything it moved, so the web API is unchanged.
  - `@nexub/tokens/native`: tokens for React Native. Dimensions as dp numbers, colour roles resolved to hex per contrast level × scheme (plus product remaps), elevation as per-scheme `boxShadow`, and springs as Reanimated configs. A test keeps them equal to the CSS.
  - `@nexub/tokens/seed`: `createSeedRoles(seed)` returns the seeded family as `{ light, dark }` hex, for native.
  - `@nexub/icons/native`: the same icon names as `@nexub/icons`, on `lucide-react-native` (an optional peer).
  - New `@nexub/react-native` (alpha):
    - `NexubNativeProvider`: scheme, contrast (follows iOS Increase Contrast / Android high-contrast text), product, seed, glass dial (off under Reduce Transparency), Reduce Motion, haptics, locale, RTL and strings.
    - Primitives: `Text`/`Heading` (role type, Dynamic Type ramps), `Pressable` (state layer + 0.97 press spring + semantic haptics), `Surface` (tonal tiers, elevation, native Liquid Glass on iOS 26+ with a solid fallback), `Box`/`Stack`/`Inline`, `Icon` and `ScreenContainer`.
    - `nexubFonts` for `useFonts` (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans, Geist Mono; OFL).

- 080d2a4: **React Native mobile-only components** (MOBILE_PLAN.md, phase M3), alpha:

  - **Overlays:** `BottomSheet` (detents incl. 'content', drag to resize or dismiss, grabber that cycles detents and is screen-reader operable, keyboard-aware), `ActionSheet` (the system sheet on iOS, a sheet on Android), `ContextMenu` (long-press, with the same items as accessibility actions), `Select` (a field that opens a sheet of choices).
  - **Gestures and lists:** `SwipeableRow` (swipe actions are also accessibility actions; the row is one element), themed `RefreshControl`, `Carousel` + `PageIndicator`.
  - **Payub inputs:** `OTPInput` (one field, so SMS autofill works: iOS oneTimeCode / Android sms-otp), `NumericKeypad`, `ExpressiveMoneyInput`, `DateTimeField` (platform pickers; optional peer `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`).
  - **Flow and privacy:** `StickyFooter` (primary action above the keyboard), `SensitiveValue` (masked, read as "hidden", re-masks in the background), `PrivacyShield` (covers the app-switcher snapshot; `preventCapture` with optional peer `expo-screen-capture`), `OfflineBanner`, `Coachmark`, `FAB` (Android only by default).
  - **Navigation, native chrome in Nexub colours:** `nexubStackOptions`, `nexubNavigationTheme`, `nexubTabsOptions`, `useNexubNavigation()`.
  - `@nexub/core`: mobile strings (resize, cancel, show/hide, hidden, keypad delete, code digit, offline, page, more actions).
  - `@nexub/icons`: `Delete` (backspace) icon.
  - `@nexub/react-native` exposes a `source` export condition for monorepo development; published installs use the built files.

### Minor Changes

- c0fe350: Fix the colour `<NexubMark>` (and `<Logo>`, `AppHeader`, `SettingsLayout`) rendering black on server-rendered pages with a strict Content-Security-Policy. Its gradient stops now use `nxm-*` classes from `@nexub/themes/base` instead of inline `style` attributes, so make sure `base.css` is imported.

## 1.3.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d296fe3: **New pattern `AppLauncher`** (the "waffle" app switcher), replacing the copies hand-built in each app.
  - `<AppLauncher apps={[{ id, name, href, icon?, current? }]} onNavigate? surface? label? />`: an `IconButton` ("Nexub apps") opens a 320px `Popover` (aligned to the end) with a 3-column grid of app tiles (40px rounded icon and name).
  - Missing or broken icons fall back to an `Avatar` with initials. The current app is subtly highlighted and marked `aria-current="page"`.
  - Keyboard: opens with focus on the current app; arrow keys move through the grid, Home/End jump to the ends. `onNavigate(app)` takes over plain clicks for client-side routing; modified clicks still open the link.
  - `surface="glass"` supported. Renders nothing for an empty list.
  - `@nexub/icons`: new `Apps` icon (3×3 dots).

- d296fe3: **Branding: the official Nexub mark in `Logo`.**
  - `NexubMark` (`@nexub/icons`) now draws the official Nexub mark (the purple-blue ribbon), taken from the master SVG without redrawing. It replaces the placeholder "B". New `variant` prop: `"mono"` (default, `currentColor`, as before) or `"color"`. Each instance gets its own gradient ids, so several marks on one page don't clash.
  - `Logo` gets `mark="color" | "mono"` (default `"color"`) and `product?: string`. With `product`, it renders the mark, "nexub", a subtle separator and the product name in muted text at the wordmark's size, e.g. `<Logo product="Command Hub" />`. The accessible name becomes "Nexub Command Hub".
  - `Logo` `variant="icon"` is the new name for the mark-only variant. `variant="mark"` still works. `Logo` now has `role="img"`, so its name is announced.
  - The mark is sized by height at its real 78:56 ratio (it used to sit in a square box).
  - `@nexub/tokens`: 47 new brand tokens, `--color-brand-mark-1` … `--color-brand-mark-47` (Tailwind `brand-mark-*`), holding the mark's gradient colours. `Logo` and `NexubMark` contain no hex values.

- d296fe3: **New icons `Pin`, `Send` and `Crown`**, so apps no longer need Bookmark, ArrowUp and Star as stand-ins.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 50236f4: ESM-only packages, working tree-shaking, and RSC-safe builds.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/react`, `@nexub/patterns` and `@nexub/icons` ship ESM only (CJS builds removed). `@nexub/tokens` exports gain a `default` condition, so `require('@nexub/tokens/tailwind')` now works on Node ≥20.19.
  - `@nexub/react` and `@nexub/patterns` are built per component and every output file starts with `'use client'`, so they import cleanly from Next.js Server Components. A single-component import drops from ~130 KB gz to ~6–9 KB gz.
  - `@nexub/icons`: unused icons are now tree-shaken (one icon ≈1 KB gz, was ≈10 KB).
  - The Tailwind preset now registers `tailwindcss-animate`, so component enter/exit animations actually render. `tailwindcss` is an optional peer of `@nexub/tokens`.
  - `@nexub/themes`: dark mode is no longer forced when `data-theme` is absent; with no attribute the OS preference decides.
  - **Breaking:** `ThemeProvider` drops the `attribute` prop (`class` mode never matched the theme CSS). `system` mode now removes `data-theme` instead of setting it, and the provider no longer causes hydration mismatches. `useMediaQuery` starts `false` on first render.

- 7d8ed02: Lighter packages and cleaner dependencies.
  - `@nexub/icons`: add `Camera` and `Layers`. Drop the unused `@radix-ui/react-slot` dependency.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/tokens`: remove the empty `./css/light` and `./css/dark` stub exports; use `@nexub/themes/light` and `/dark`. Stop shipping source maps that pointed at unpublished `src/`.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/react`: `@nexub/tokens` moves from a dependency to a peer dependency (install it alongside). It was only used for CSS variables and the Tailwind preset, never imported from JS.

### Patch Changes

- 0a71d8d: Accessibility and stability fixes.
  - **Contrast (WCAG AA):** new `--color-fill-*` tokens (fixed shades, white text ≥ 4.5:1 in light and dark). Button, IconButton, Badge (solid), Checkbox, Pagination, Sidebar, DatePicker, FilterChip, AlertDialog and StepIndicator use them. Primary is now brand-600, which is visibly a little deeper. `--color-text-{info,success,warning,danger}` now alias the `-strong` shades, placeholder text uses `text-muted`, and icon tones follow the text tones.
  - **Focus ring:** `--shadow-focus` follows `--color-ring-*`, so it's correct in dark mode and brand themes.
  - **Slider:** thumbs no longer remount (and lose focus) on every value change. New `thumbLabels` prop; `aria-label` now names the thumb.
  - **Rating:** radio-group keyboard support (one tab stop, arrows, Home/End).
  - **Motion:** exits always complete, even when `transitionend` never fires (e.g. `duration="instant"`). Bubbled child events are ignored.
  - **Toaster** renders `action`. The close button stays visible on touch devices.
  - **Autocomplete** shows the selected label (not the id), filters by label, and renders a real "Loading…".
  - **NumberInput:** steppers respect bounds when `disabled={false}`.
  - **TopNav:** the menu scrolls instead of disappearing below `md`; `<nav aria-label="Main">`; `Item` supports `asChild`.
  - **Breaking:** **Sidebar:** the root is now `<nav aria-label="Sidebar">` (was `<aside>`); `Item` supports `asChild`, keeps an accessible name and tooltip when collapsed.
  - **Link:** new-tab links always get `noopener noreferrer` (merged with the caller's `rel`); supports `asChild`.
  - `@nexub/tokens`: brand-primary-800 is now `#1e40af` (was a copy of 900).
