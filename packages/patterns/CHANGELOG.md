# @nexub/patterns

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d907d10: **Strict CSP: `Sheet` / `Drawer` can lock scroll without an injected `<style>`.**
  - New `scrollLock` prop on `Sheet.Root` / `Drawer.Root`: `"style"` (default, unchanged) or `"class"`. With `"class"`, page scroll is locked by the `nexub-scroll-lock` class from `@nexub/themes/base` on `<html>` (keeping the scrollbar's space, so nothing shifts) instead of Radix's injected `<style>` tag, which `style-src 'self'` blocks. The sheet stays modal: focus trap, hidden background for screen readers, Escape and outside-click still work.
  - `SettingsLayout`'s phone menu uses `scrollLock="class"`, so it opens under a strict CSP with no console error and the page behind is locked.
  - `@nexub/themes/base` also ships Radix's scrollbar-hiding rule for `ScrollArea` and `Select` viewports, so they look right when a strict CSP blocks Radix's `<style>` tag.
  - New docs page, Getting Started → Strict CSP: which components are CSP-safe and how to use the others.
- d907d10: **`Sidebar.Header` with a product logo and a status.** New `Sidebar.Header` takes the logo as children and an optional `status` (e.g. a "Live" `Badge`). They sit on one row when they fit; otherwise the status moves under the logo. When the sidebar is collapsed, the status is visually hidden but still announced.
  - `Logo` with `product` truncates the product name with an ellipsis when its container is too narrow, instead of overflowing.
  - `SettingsLayout`'s top bar lets a long product logo shrink and truncate next to the actions.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d296fe3: **New pattern `AppLauncher`** (the "waffle" app switcher), replacing the copies hand-built in each app.
  - `<AppLauncher apps={[{ id, name, href, icon?, current? }]} onNavigate? surface? label? />`: an `IconButton` ("Nexub apps") opens a 320px `Popover` (aligned to the end) with a 3-column grid of app tiles (40px rounded icon and name).
  - Missing or broken icons fall back to an `Avatar` with initials. The current app is subtly highlighted and marked `aria-current="page"`.
  - Keyboard: opens with focus on the current app; arrow keys move through the grid, Home/End jump to the ends. `onNavigate(app)` takes over plain clicks for client-side routing; modified clicks still open the link.
  - `surface="glass"` supported. Renders nothing for an empty list.
  - `@nexub/icons`: new `Apps` icon (3×3 dots).

- d296fe3: **New pattern `SettingsLayout`** (the My Account layout) and **`SettingsRow`**.
  - Full-width frame: a `TopNav` with `logo` and `actions` slots, and a left `Sidebar` of sections built from `items: { id, label, icon, href }[]`, with `activeId` highlighted. It works with any router: `onSelect(item)` takes over plain clicks, and `href` still works for modified clicks.
  - Under 768px the sidebar becomes a menu button that opens a left `Sheet` with the same items. Choosing one closes it.
  - Content area (max width 3xl) with an optional page header (`title`, `description`). Children are sections: use `SettingsLayout.Section` (a `Card` with an optional title and description).
  - `SettingsRow` (also `SettingsLayout.Row`): label (and optional description) on the left, value in the middle, action on the right. It stacks on phones.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 50236f4: ESM-only packages, working tree-shaking, and RSC-safe builds.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/react`, `@nexub/patterns` and `@nexub/icons` ship ESM only (CJS builds removed). `@nexub/tokens` exports gain a `default` condition, so `require('@nexub/tokens/tailwind')` now works on Node ≥20.19.
  - `@nexub/react` and `@nexub/patterns` are built per component and every output file starts with `'use client'`, so they import cleanly from Next.js Server Components. A single-component import drops from ~130 KB gz to ~6–9 KB gz.
  - `@nexub/icons`: unused icons are now tree-shaken (one icon ≈1 KB gz, was ≈10 KB).
  - The Tailwind preset now registers `tailwindcss-animate`, so component enter/exit animations actually render. `tailwindcss` is an optional peer of `@nexub/tokens`.
  - `@nexub/themes`: dark mode is no longer forced when `data-theme` is absent; with no attribute the OS preference decides.
  - **Breaking:** `ThemeProvider` drops the `attribute` prop (`class` mode never matched the theme CSS). `system` mode now removes `data-theme` instead of setting it, and the provider no longer causes hydration mismatches. `useMediaQuery` starts `false` on first render.

### Patch Changes

- 0a71d8d: Accessibility and stability fixes.
  - **Contrast (WCAG AA):** new `--color-fill-*` tokens (fixed shades, white text ≥ 4.5:1 in light and dark). Button, IconButton, Badge (solid), Checkbox, Pagination, Sidebar, DatePicker, FilterChip, AlertDialog and StepIndicator use them. Primary is now brand-600, which is visibly a little deeper. `--color-text-{info,success,warning,danger}` now alias the `-strong` shades, placeholder text uses `text-muted`, and icon tones follow the text tones.
  - **Focus ring:** `--shadow-focus` follows `--color-ring-*`, so it's correct in dark mode and brand themes.
  - **Slider:** thumbs no longer remount (and lose focus) on every value change. New `thumbLabels` prop; `aria-label` now names the thumb.
  - **Rating:** radio-group keyboard support (one tab stop, arrows, Home/End).
  - **Motion:** exits always complete, even when `transitionend` never fires (e.g. `duration="instant"`). Bubbled child events are ignored.
  - **Toaster** renders `action`. The close button stays visible on touch devices.
  - **Autocomplete** shows the selected label (not the id), filters by label, and renders a real "Loading…".
  - **NumberInput:** steppers respect bounds when `disabled={false}`.
  - **TopNav:** the menu scrolls instead of disappearing below `md`; `<nav aria-label="Main">`; `Item` supports `asChild`.
  - **Breaking:** **Sidebar:** the root is now `<nav aria-label="Sidebar">` (was `<aside>`); `Item` supports `asChild`, keeps an accessible name and tooltip when collapsed.
  - **Link:** new-tab links always get `noopener noreferrer` (merged with the caller's `rel`); supports `asChild`.
  - `@nexub/tokens`: brand-primary-800 is now `#1e40af` (was a copy of 900).

- 7d8ed02: Lighter packages and cleaner dependencies.
  - `@nexub/icons`: add `Camera` and `Layers`. Drop the unused `@radix-ui/react-slot` dependency.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/tokens`: remove the empty `./css/light` and `./css/dark` stub exports; use `@nexub/themes/light` and `/dark`. Stop shipping source maps that pointed at unpublished `src/`.
  - **Breaking:** `@nexub/react`: `@nexub/tokens` moves from a dependency to a peer dependency (install it alongside). It was only used for CSS variables and the Tailwind preset, never imported from JS.
